# check-external.sh — detect drift between vpinball's upstream build
# scripts and the inputs wired into this flake.
#
# Strategy: for each *_SHA / *_VERSION variable that vpinball's
# linux-x64/external.sh actually references (and the equivalent for the
# transitive libdmdutil/libdof/libzedmd configs), make sure flake.nix's
# update hooks also reference it. Any var that isn't referenced is a
# potential new upstream dependency that hasn't been wired into the
# flake yet.
#
# Platform is hard-coded to linux-x64 because that's the only system
# this flake supports. Vars declared in config.sh but unused on linux-x64
# (e.g. OPENXR_SHA, which is windows/android only) are intentionally
# ignored.
#
# Exit 0 on clean, 1 on drift detected, 2 on tool failure.
